# CodeRadio Refactor

A _bare-bones_ module for injecting CodeRadio into the various freeCodeCamp platforms.

Thoughts:

- [ ] A module which contains no UI, and is attached to existing UI?
- [ ] A module which contains a component UI accepting styling?
- [ ] A module class with `playHandler`, `volumeHandler`, and `trackHandler` methods?
